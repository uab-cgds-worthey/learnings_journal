# learnings_journal

Repository to document tips and tricks we learn on how to use certain tools.

> **_NOTE:_**  In a past life, QuaC used a different remote Git management provider, [UAB
> Gitlab](https://gitlab.rc.uab.edu/center-for-computational-genomics-and-data-science/sciops/learnings_journal). It was migrated to
> Github in June 2023, and the Gitlab version has been archived.
